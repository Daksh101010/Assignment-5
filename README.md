# Assignment-5
Task1 and Task2

Asign5[Task1].py - gives a Python program that:
1.   Creates a dictionary where student names are keys and their marks are values.
2.   Asks the user to input a student's name.
3.   Retrieves and displays the corresponding marks.
4.   If the student’s name is not found, display an appropriate message.
TASK1{output} - is the output for 1st program

Asign5[Task2].py - is the code of Python that:
1.   Creates a list of numbers from 1 to 10.
2.   Extracts the first five elements from the list.
3.   Reverses these extracted elements.
4.   Prints both the extracted list and the reversed list

TAsk1
This program keeps a record where each student’s name is written along with their marks, just like a marks list in a notebook. The user is asked to type a student’s name. If that name exists in the record, the program shows the marks of that student. If the name is not in the record, it clearly tells the user that the student was not found.

Task2
This program first makes a list of numbers from 1 to 10, like writing numbers in order on a paper. Then it picks only the first five numbers from that list. After that, it flips the order of those five numbers, putting the last one first and the first one last. Finally, it shows both the selected numbers and their reversed order.
